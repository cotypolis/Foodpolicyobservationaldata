## How easy do you find it to read the labelling on food products?

Alternatives: 
-9	Refused
-8	Don't know
-1	Not applicable
1	Very easy to read
2	Quite easy to read
3	Neither easy nor difficult to read
4	Quite difficult to read
5	Very difficult to read



```{r label1, echo=FALSE}

# Count the number of cases per alternative using table()

table(FoodandYou_2010_2018$`How easy do you find it to read the labelling on food products (e.g. ingredients, nutrition or storage information) in terms of the size of the print (using glasses or contact lenses if you wear them)?`, FoodandYou_2010_2018$Wave) 

```

## In response to when you had food poisoning [more than once or most recently] have you done any of the following: Read food labels more carefully

Alternatives:

## Missing values

```{r miss, echo=FALSE}

library(dplyr)

  filter(!`How easy do you find it to read the labelling on food products (e.g. ingredients, nutrition or storage information) in terms of the size of the print (using glasses or contact lenses if you wear them)?` %in% c(-8, -2), !is.na(`How easy do you find it to read the labelling on food products (e.g. ingredients, nutrition or storage information) in terms of the size of the print (using glasses or contact lenses if you wear them)?`))

```

## Difference-in-Differences (DiD), no differences in policy implementation

```{r did, echo=FALSE}

# Assuming 'year' is your time variable and the policy was implemented in 2015
FoodandYou_2010_2018_na$policy <- ifelse(FoodandYou_2010_2018_na$Wave >= 2014, 1, 0)

# Now, every observation has a 'policy' indicator: 0 for pre-policy and 1 for post-policy

# Load the necessary library
library(lmtest)

# Run the DiD model
did_model <- lm(`How easy do you find it to read the labelling on food products (e.g. ingredients, nutrition or storage information) in terms of the size of the print (using glasses or contact lenses if you wear them)?` ~ policy, data = FoodandYou_2010_2018_na)

did_model1 <- lm(`How easy do you find it to read the labelling on food products (e.g. ingredients, nutrition or storage information) in terms of the size of the print (using glasses or contact lenses if you wear them)?` ~ policy + Gender, data = FoodandYou_2010_2018_na)

# View the summary of the model
summary(did_model)
summary(did_model1)

```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
